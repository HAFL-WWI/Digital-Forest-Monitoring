# Digital-Forest-Monitoring

### Forest monitoring apps and services based on remote sensing data.

#### An online version of the app can be found here: [https://forestmonitoring.lab.karten-werk.ch](https://forestmonitoring.lab.karten-werk.ch)

## Getting Started

You can get a local copy of the project by running this command on your console:

```
git clone git@github.com:HAFL-FWI/Digital-Forest-Monitoring.git
```

After that, you should have a new directory named "Digital-Forest-Monitoring". Enter it by typing...
`cd Digital-Forest-Monitoring/webapp`.

### Prerequisites

The project needs the package manager [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/). You can install it from [here](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install).
Also it is very recommended to install the version control system [Git](https://git-scm.com/) on your machine.

In order to be able to use the wms services in development mode, you have to add an entry to your hosts file.
Under windows you can do this like so:

- Press the Windows key.
- Type Notepad in the search field.
- In the search results, right-click Notepad and select Run as administrator.
- From Notepad, open the following file: `c:\Windows\System32\Drivers\etc\hosts`
- add an entry: `127.0.0.1 app.karten-werk.ch`
- Select File > Save to save your changes.

### Installing

While in the newly created folder, install all the dependencies.

```zsh
yarn install
```

After that, you can start a development server by enter the following command...

```zsh
yarn run start
```

This command starts the bundling process and opens the development server on port 1234 => [http://localhost:1234](http://localhost:1234).
In order to use the wms services in development mode, you should instead open: [http://app.karten-werk.ch:1234](http://app.karten-werk.ch:1234)

This works because of the change in the _hosts_ file.

## Deployment

On Linux, OSX

```zsh
yarn run build
```

On Windows

```zsh
yarn run buildOnWin
```

This disables watch mode and hot module replacement so it will only build once. It also enables the minifier for all output bundles to reduce file size. The minifiers used by Parcel are [terser](https://github.com/terser/terser) for JavaScript, [cssnano](https://cssnano.co/) for CSS, and [htmlnano](https://github.com/posthtml/htmlnano) for HTML.
After that, you can copy the contents of the `dist` folder to your webservers root directory.

## Linting

This project uses [eslint](https://eslint.org/). You can start the linter by typing `yarn run lint`. It it recommended to integrate the linter in the IDE of your choice. See [https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/integrations](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/integrations) for more info.
Altough it's not integrated in this project, we use [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) in order to format the code. Prettier can be integrated in [various IDE's](https://prettier.io/docs/en/editors.html) and we recommend it very much.

## Built with

- [YARN](https://yarnpkg.com/) - Package Management
- [parcel](https://parceljs.org/) - Blazing fast, zero configuration web application bundler
- [Navigo](https://github.com/krasimir/navigo) A simple vanilla JavaScript router with a fallback for older browsers.
- [OpenLayers](https://openlayers.org/) A high-performance, feature-packed library for all your mapping needs.
